/**
 * Clock tracks the time in the simulation.
 *
 * The basic unit is 1 fm in natural units which correspond to
 * \f$\frac{10^{-15}}{299\,792\,458}\,\mathrm{s} \approx
 * 0.33\cdot10^{-23}\,\mathrm{s}\f$ in the international system of units. The
 * resolution of the clock is \f$0.000001\,\mathrm{fm}=10^{-6}\,\mathrm{fm}\f$,
 * i.e. only multiples of \f$0.000001\,\mathrm{fm}\f$ are internally
 * representable.
 *
 * \attention
 * There are two very different types of clocks implemented.
 * -# The UniformClock is meant to track time in a simulation and it has the
 *    quite peculiar feature that it is aware of the end time of the simulation.
 *    Therefore, although it can be ticked beyond such a time, its methods about
 *    the current time, the next time and the time-step duration will adjust
 *    their return value when the clock gets to or past the simulation end time.
 * -# The CustomClock is meant to track a list of time points and it is best
 *    suited for output. Ticking this clock means to consider the following
 *    point in time. Ticking beyond the last time point is considered an error.
 *
 * ### Potential usage for adapting time steps:
 *
 * \code
 *   const double end_time = 10.;
 *   UniformClock lab_time(0., 0.1, end_time);
 *   while (lab_time < end_time) {
 *     // do something
 *     // adapt the timestep size to external circumstances:
 *     if (system_is_very_dense()) {
 *       lab_time.set_timestep_duration(lab_time.timestep_duration() / 2.);
 *     }
 *     if (system_is_very_dilute()) {
 *       lab_time.set_timestep_duration(lab_time.timestep_duration() * 2.);
 *     }
 *     // let the clock tick
 *     ++lab_time;
 *   }
 * \endcode
 *
 * ### Possible actions for Clock
 *
 * \li look at it and find out the current time
 * \see current_time()
 * \see next_time()
 * \li advance the clock (by one tick, by several ticks, or by a given
 * time)
 * \see operator++()
 * \see UniformClock::operator+=(T)
 * \see operator+=(Representation)
 * \li set / retrieve the timestep (length of one tick)
 * \see UniformClock::set_timestep_duration(double)
 * \see timestep_duration()
 * \li compare time against different clock or fixed value
 * \see operator<(const Clock&) const
 * \see operator<(double) const
 * \see operator>(double) const

 * changed, \f$t_0\f$ is reset to the present time and \f$n\f$ is set to 0.
 * As soon as \f$t\geq t_{end}\f$, the clock will always return \f$t_{end}\f$ as
 * current and next time. The time step size can be retrieved and the returned
 * value is
 * \f[
 * \begin{aligned}
 *   \Delta t       \qquad&\mbox{if}& &t\leq t_{end}-\Delta t \\
